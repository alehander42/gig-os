osdev experiments

a fork of [a basic wiki osdev kernel](http://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton), also looking at [intermezzo](http://intermezzos.github.io/)

# todo:

- [ ] a keyboard driver
- [ ] a basic filesystem-in-ram driver
- [ ] a basic monotasking shell
- [ ] several simple shell programs(probably realized as kernel files for now)
